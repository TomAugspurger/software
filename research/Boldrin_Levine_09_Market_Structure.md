Notes on Boldrin & Levine (2009) - Market Structure and Property Rights
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary ###

Open source industries epitomize a competitive market and are the rule rather than the exception.

Defined by the ability to own objects produced but not the ideas embodied in them.

Spend a while attacking the copyright extension law (Copyright Term Extension Act) of 1998.

Reiterate some stories from OSS: Red-Hat, etc.

```To earn rent through the sale of something, it must be something in short supply.```

Pecuniary Externality: ```[A]lthough my using an idea does not make you less able to use it, it might well make you less able to sell it.  This means my ownership of a copy of the same idea as you own does not make the idea less valuable from a social point of view, but it certainly reduces the market price of you copy.```
